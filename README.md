Bootstrap Icons
======================

The Bootstrap Icons module loads the [Bootstrap Icons library](https://icons.getbootstrap.com). It can be a useful add-on to the [Bootstrap Lite](https://backdropcms.org/project/bootstrap_lite) or [Bootstrap 5 Lite](https://backdropcms.org/project/bootstrap5_lite) themes, or any other theme where you need some icons.

Installation
------------

- Install this module using [the official Backdrop CMS instructions]( https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules).

- Visit the configuration page under Administration > Configuration >
Content Authoring > Boostrap Icons (admin/config/content/bootstrap_icons) where you will find a setting to choose whether to use the CDN or the bundled library.

Related Modules
-------------

A different set of icons can be found in the [Font Awesome](https://backdropcms.org/project/font_awesome) contrib module.

The [Bootstrap Lite](https://backdropcms.org/project/bootstrap_lite) theme includes the FontAwesome library (either bundled or via CDN).

The [Bootstrap 5 Lite](https://backdropcms.org/project/bootstrap5_lite) theme does not provide an icon library built-in, but you can add this module or the [Font Awesome](https://backdropcms.org/project/font_awesome) contrib module (or both, if you wish).
